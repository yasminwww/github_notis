1. Add delete webhook functionality.

2. Somehow check if the organization is still active (existing),
    if not, remove from database.

3. SOCKET EVERYWHERE! but mostly when updating settings and receiving new events.






## Random information:

Slack Wekhook page that i never could find:
https://api.slack.com/apps/AU4BD2RR7/incoming-webhooks?success=1




// TODO: WEBHOOK URL INSTRUCTIONS: ALWAYS USE '/' at the end of a url, 
// otherwise the browser will give 302!!

IF build does not work with heroku and react, then run command:
 git rm cached (something like that)
